Utility for background calibration, curation and tuning of the device towards an intuitive interface.

Subsystems being battery, entropy, encryption, disk, cpu, memory, filesystem, ui, scheduler, and network, all safe and open source technology.

Presented in this educational gaming metric format with infinite feedback and an interestingly assymetric chance. scribble anywhere, check in some stress, or find the 8!

- waut.ch! does one hope to receive from this?

Well, increasing degrees and amounts of a certain "Je ne sais quoi" or responsiveness from the user interface for a start. Better battery life perhaps. Better quality of life, maybe.

And waut.ch! can only perhaps be described as "A qualified quantification of the placebo effect"

waut.ch! might benefit from this?

waut.ch! - Sometimes used in some colloquium as "watch!", keen upon reducing the TDP of mobile devices to 1.0 watt!

Please uninstall either Seeder or CrossBreeder prior to using this.

Root recommended, else reactivity metric is interesting and introduces uniqueness into the entropy pool anyway.  Metric may demonstrate a certain asymmetry that is expected from predictable human actions. Efforts have been made to remove time seed logic from haveged in order to improve upon encryption and system-wide performance and security.

Also numerous other subsystems require careful calibration to facilitate this process.

Rewritten code, subset of functionality for upstream project - CrossBreeder ( https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2113150 )

Please feel free to view and analyze source and functionality and report bugs and discuss etc on the XDA forum:

Please visit: /data/data/ch.waut/files/bin on the device itself for partial shell source code and XDA Downloads section and Github for full source code.

Reboot at convenience liberally or sparingly to reseed the entropy pool or as is known in common parlance, for good luck!

Thanks.
